Description=SolidLab Perftest Agent
# Indicate that we use the network.
#    When starting up, this does not guarantee "the IP is ready", only that "network management stack is up". (Which is enough to start listening on a socket)
#    When shutting down, this does guarantee that this service gets stopped before network is taken down.
# (Avoid using network-online.target if not needed. It delays startup. If you use it, use it in both After= and Wants=)
After=network.target
